ALGORITHM
1. Start of program
2. Structures Defined:
 File: Contains a name and content.
 Directory: Contains a name, arrays for subdirectories and files, counters for the
number of subdirectories and files.
3. Function createDirectory:
 Check if the number of subdirectories in the parent directory has not reached
the limit (MAX_FILES).
 Allocate memory for a new directory.
 Initialize the new directory's name, number of subdirectories, and number of
files.
 Add the new directory to the parent's subdirectory list and increment the count
of subdirectories.
 Print a message indicating successful directory creation or an error if the limit is
reached.
4. Function createFile:
 Check if the number of files in the parent directory has not reached the limit
(MAX_FILES).
 Create a new file structure with a given name and content.
 Add the new file to the parent directory's file list and increment the count of
files.
 Print a message indicating successful file creation or an error if the limit is
reached.
5. Function listContents:
 Display the contents of a directory:
 Print the directory's name.
 Iterate through the subdirectories and print their names.
 Iterate through the files and print their names.
6. main Function:
 Create a root directory.

 Prompt the user to input the name of a directory (dirName) and create it using
createDirectory.
 Prompt the user to input the name of a file (fileName) and its content
(fileContent), then create the file using createFile.
 Display the contents of the root directory using listContents.
7. Input Validation and Display:
 The program takes user input for directory and file creation.
 It checks for limitations on the number of subdirectories and files.
 Displays the created directory and its contents including subdirectories and files.
